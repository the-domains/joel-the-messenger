<p><b>Music Bio - Joel the Messenger </b></p><p>For every person with an open heart, there can be found the power of Jesus through any medium that carries his or her Spirit. I have been blessed to share His love and grace in the form of music, through which I exercise my creativity, devotion and faithfulness. We are no longer orphans, we are children of God who are empowered with authority through His Spirit that calls us out into the wilderness.
 
Jesus has given us the ability to show our love and humility with one another in many ways. My heart for music and relationship with Him inspire me to create songs in His name while sharing the love He has shown to me on my journey. Having found Jesus, I have been given another chance to have a place in the world with opportunities to share my testimony. He has shown me His love by gifting me with a creative capacity, which I am so grateful for and will use to spread His word far and wide. He has literally given me everything He can, so I will do all that I can for others. </p><p> Through my music I have learned so much about what it takes to listen, to communicate, and get the most out of every moment. With revived inspiration and passion, I can use the knowledge from my former internet marketing business to promote events that I am involved with and attract specific audiences. Many people desire salvation in their hearts, but sadly have no idea where to look. People walk by us every day spiritually exhausted and dying inside with no hope or joy for tomorrow. My goal is to give as many people as I can the opportunity to find Him. </p><p>By promoting love and unity under his grace we can offer hope and happiness to the people who desire it in their hearts, and open the hearts of those that have shut theirs during a life of trouble and pain. So many people want to be saved but have no idea where to look or how to start. My life was much the same way, and by his grace I was shown the right path. My heart's desire is to become a light of belief for the lives of others, just as at it was brought to mine. By networking through my music I am able to find people with a common vision who see the salvation of others as important as that of their own. </p><p>I’m doing my best to be a light in the darkness just as my Heavenly Father has instructed us to be. I am still a work in progress as He works on me every single day in Houston while the story of my life unfolds. Before Christ I was a different person, this person was my old self, but that person died and my life is now hidden in Him. This doesn't mean I will never stumble or fall back into old habits, but I will call them what they are - old habits of the old person who has been crucified with Jesus - and is no more. </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">joel-the-messenger</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
